# PLN Based Next Token Prediction

You are not hallucinating, as the title suggests, this document is
indeed about doing next token prediction using PLN as a complete, and
I dare to dream, better substitute for LLMs.

## Overview

Is next token prediction doable in practice using PLN?  This is the
question we will begin to attempt to answer in this document.  But why
would one want to use PLN to do next token prediction in the first
place?  I believe there are several advantages:

1. Learning with PLN could be potentially far more sample efficient
   than transformers.  Thus requiring smaller corpora of texts than
   traditionally used.
2. Doing next token prediction could be a way to bypass Semantic
   Parsing (turning natural language into logic).  Everything could
   potentially be done in PLN, semantic parsing, logical reasoning and
   text generation.
3. Since everything would be done with PLN it should be easier to add
   domain specific knowledge, either via prompting or by formulating
   the knowledge directly in logic.
4. Adding higher level goals would also be more natural, providing a
   more elegant and versatile alternative to finetuning.  Same thing
   for connecting other modalities.
5. With PLN there is no clear separation between training and
   inference.  Everything would happen online.  Whenever a prompt
   would be entered it would simultaneously be part of the short term
   context and the longer term corpus.
6. No need to limit carrying the thinking phase (for reasoning LLMs
   like deepseek-r1) in natural language.  PLN could carry the
   thinking at whichever level of abstraction it chooses so.
7. Reduce hallucination.

But there are also disadvantages:

1. PLN reasoning potentially requires far more computational resources
   than transformers.
2. To have any hope of it working at all would require excellent,
   practical, sophisticated attentional allocation and inference
   control mechanisms.  This is both a disadvantage and an advantage
   though, because, in principle, such attentional allocation and
   inference control mechanisms could in fact outperform transformers,
   possibly dramatically, especially for training, but also for
   inference.

## Experimental Setup

### Tokenization

Maybe tokenization could ultimately be carried out by PLN itself but
for starter I suggest to do it as a pre-processing step, as it is
traditionally done.  At the end of the tokenization process one should
obtain a list of tokens alongside their frequencies, as usually, and
their counts, as not so usual.  The counts are important for PLN.

### Representing Next Token Prediction Task

Once the tokens, their frequencies and counts have been established
the next question is how to represent the token prediction task.  One
may legitimately ask whether the task should take place in "token
space" or in "embedding space".  Ideally, I think it should take place
in token space and leave PLN to create whatever embedding space, or
substitute thereof, happens to emerge from reasoning.  But one could
also try to mimick more closely transformers and pre-build a PLN-ized
version of an embedding space.

In any case, let me provide two ways to formulate the token prediction
task.

#### Using NextToken Predicate

Define a probabilistic categorical predicate `NextToken` with the
following type signature:

```
NextToken : (List Token) -> ùõ∫ -> Token
```

using a curried representation.  The probabilistic aspect of
`NextToken` is captured by the argument `ùõ∫`.  Explaining `ùõ∫` in detail
is beyond the scope of this document but can be found
[here](https://github.com/trueagi-io/pln-experimental/blob/main/docs/nuPLN/nuPLN.pdf).

Calling `NextToken` a "categorical predicate" might be too much of a
linguistic stretch, so let me explain what I mean.  PLN traditionally
operates on (probabilistic) predicates, functions with a Boolean
codomain, that is what justifies using a Beta distribution as the
underlying second order distribution associated to a truth value.  The
Token type is not Boolean but categorical.  It could be represented by
the product of `N` predicates (where `N` is the logarithm of the
cardinality of `Token`), or, probably better, by upgrading PLN to
support categories.  I believe this should not be difficult.  The
underlying Beta distribution would be replaced by a Dirichlet
distribution and the various predicate operators, conjunction,
disjunctions, etc, would be generalized to work with categories.  The
following old but still relevant [Github issue](https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/issues/833) discusses such
generalization (which can also be viewed as a generalization of
distributional truth values described in the [PLN Book](http://goertzel.org/PLN_BOOK_6_27_08.pdf)).

The PLN knowledge base would be initialized with the following
instances:

1. Marginal token probabilities

   ```
   (NextToken Nil) <TV‚ÇÄ>
   ```

   where `<TV‚ÇÄ>` represents the Dirichlet distribution built out of
   the frequencies and counts of the tokenization process.

2. Conditional probabilities obtained by sliding the context window
   over the corpus while varying the context window size from 1 to its
   maximum.

   ```
   (NextToken Ctx·µ¢) <TV·µ¢>
   ```

   where `i` is an index over all possible context windows.  Thus
   `Ctx·µ¢` is the ith context and `<TV·µ¢>` is the ith truth value
   obtained from the frequencies and counts of the tokens immediately
   following this context.  Of course, especially for large contexts,
   most tokens will have frequencies and counts of zero, which is
   perfectly fine.  Also, one may worry that the number of such
   instances is going to be enormous, and it is true, but no more
   enormous than what LLMs are typically dealing with, and in fact
   probably smaller if PLN based token prediction delivers on its
   promise of sample efficiency.

#### Using IthToken Predicate

An alternate representation could be to use a probabilistic
categorical predicate that maps an index to a token, instead of a
context to a token.  Let us call this predicate `IthToken` to
represent the ith token in the corpus.  Its type signature would be

```
IthToken : Nat -> ùõ∫ -> Token
```

where `Nat` is the set of indices of the corpus.  So if the corpus is

```
I¬∑ ¬∑like¬∑ ¬∑math
```

where `¬∑` is a token separator, then the intances making up `IthToken`
would be

```
(IthToken 0) <{I:1}>
(IthToken 1) <{ :1}>
(IthToken 2) <{like:1}>
(IthToken 3) <{ :1}>
(IthToken 4) <{math:1}>
```

where `<{I:1}>` represents a truth value corresponding to the
Dirichlet distribution obained by setting a count of 1 to token `I`,
and zero to everything else.  Doing next token prediction would then
amount of evaluating the truth value of `IthToken` for a new index.

One could further fill the knowledge with the following:

1. Marginal token probabilities

   ```
   IthToken <TV‚ÇÄ>
   ```

   where `<TV‚ÇÄ>` would, just like for `(NextToken Nil)`, be built out
   of the frequencies and counts of the tokenization process.

2. Conditional probabilities knowing a context of length 1

   ```
   (IthToken /-1-> IthToken) <TV‚ÇÅ>
   ```

   where `/-1->` would be a predictive implication with a lead of 1,
   thus equivalent to the following regular implication

   ```
   (IthToken -> (Lead 1 IthToken)) <TV‚ÇÅ>
   ```

   capturing the conditional probability of a next token knowing the
   current token.  See [Temporal PLN](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370994045_Probabilistic_Logic_Networks_for_Temporal_and_Procedural_Reasoning)
   for more information.

2. Conditional probabilities knowing a context of length 2

   ```
   ((IthToken |1\ IthToken) /-1-> IthToken) <TV‚ÇÇ>
   ```

   where `|1\` is a sequential conjuction with lag of 1, thus
   equivalent to the regular implication

   ```
   (((Lag 1 IthToken) /\ IthToken) -> (Lead 1 IthToken)) <TV‚ÇÇ>
   ```

   capturing the conditional probability of a next token knowing the
   current and previous tokens.

   And so on for all sizes of context windows.

### Learning and Inference

Regardless of what representation is used, `NextToken` or `IthToken`,
the fun, and the trouble, starts when PLN is free to discover patterns
and use them for prediction.  What happens from here is where the
research really begins.  Reasoning may involve a mixture of foward
chaining, to infere whatever knowledge can be derived from the
existing knowledge, combined with backward chaining given as query the
truth value of the next token given a context (thus representing a
Dirichlet distribution over `Token`).  The next token would then be
selected by applying Thompson sampling over the inferred truth value.
